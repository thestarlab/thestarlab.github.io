# Research Interests

Our research is characterized by an interdisciplinary perspective on
**spatial data science** that is driven by advances of quantitative geography
(e.g., geographic information science), earth observations (e.g., remote
sensing) and computational science. Specifically, we are interested in
development of statistical, machine learning and computational
methodologies for (1) spatiotemporal pattern modeling and analysis in
geographic phenomena and processes, (2) integrating heterogeneous spatial
and spatiotemporal data (e.g., downscaling and upscaling), (3) modeling
spatiotemporal uncertainty, and the uncertainty propagation in analysis and
models, (4) data and computation intensive spatiotemporal analysis and
modeling, and (5) geospatial-enabled cyberinfrastructure or cyberGIS, and
domain applications in environmental sciences, public health and social
sciences.
