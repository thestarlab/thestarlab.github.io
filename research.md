# Research Interests

Our research is characterized by an interdisciplinary perspective on
**spatial data science** driven by advances of quantitative geography
(e.g., geographic information science), earth observations (e.g., remote
sensing) and computational science. We are interested in deep learning of
heterogeneous geographic information to support uncertainty-aware
geographic knowledge discovery and decision making. Particularly, we focus
on the development of statistical and computational methodologies for (a)
integrating **heterogeneous sources of geographic information** (e.g.,
incompatible scales) for geographic analysis; (b) characterizing and
modeling **complex spatiotemporal patterns** in geographic phenomena and
processes; (c) characterizing and modeling **spatiotemporal bias and
uncertainty** of geographic information and the associated impacts; (d)
addressing the **computing challenges** when the data scale and model
complexity increase dramatically; and (e) building geospatial-enabled
**cyberinfrastructure** for domain scientists. Domain applications focus on
environmental sciences, public health and social sciences.
