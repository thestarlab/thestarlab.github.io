# Research Interests
Our research is characterized by an interdisciplinary perspective on
geographic information science and remote sensing. Specifically, we are
interested in development of statistical and computational methodologies
for (1) spatiotemporal pattern modeling and analysis in geographic
phenomena and processes, (2) integrating heterogeneous spatial and
spatiotemporal data, (3) modeling spatiotemporal uncertainty, and the
uncertainty propagation in analysis and models, (4) data and computation
intensive spatiotemporal analysis and modeling, and (5) geospatial-enabled
cyberinfrastructure or cyberGIS, and domain applications in environmental
sciences, public health and social sciences.
