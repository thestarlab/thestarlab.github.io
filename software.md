Here is a list of tools that we created, along with links to the
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) projects. More is brewing in the house. 

# Selected Software Packages

- [SMC](https://github.com/surfcao/scm) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for
  statistical modeling of spatial categorical data (e.g., land use, land
cover and image post-classification results). Implemented methods include
the spatial transition probability (or transiogram) and related spatial
Markov chain methods, spatial multinomial models with mixed effects and
related model inferences. Basic mapping capacities, sample data and tutorials are
also included in the toolbox.

# Selected Datasets 
- [Here](https://github.com/thestarlab/data) is a times series of datasets
  (in ESRI shapefile) of Chinese urban boundaries for the years of 2004,
2006, 2008 and 2010, derived from nighttime remote sensing imagery
constrained to city development statistics. 

- [Here](https://github.com/thestarlab/data) is a times series of gridded
  datasets (1km spatial resolution, in ESRI Img) of PM2.5 concentration of
the continental United States during 2001-2012; each of the dataset
represents the average concentration of three sliding years.  

- [Here](https://github.com/thestarlab/data) is a times series of gridded
  datasets (1km spatial resolution, in ESRI Img) of PM2.5 concentration of
the continental United States during 2001-2012; each of the dataset
represents the average concentration of three sliding years.  

- [Here](https://github.com/thestarlab/data) contains a times series of
  gridded datasets (1km spatial resolution, in ESRI Img) of the projected
GDP of China between 2014-2020. The datasets were generated using night
time remote sensing imagery and economic survey data.

- [Here](https://github.com/thestarlab/data) is a dataset (csv file) of the
  estimated weekly influenza incidences (ILI+) across 79 major cities of
the United States between January 2005 and December of 2014. The ILI+ was
produced by a combination of Google Flu Trends and CDC's virologic
surveillance reports.
