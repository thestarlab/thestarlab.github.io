  blurb: is a GIS professor at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu),
          also the director of the STAR lab. His research primarily focuses
          on developing statistical methods and high performance computing
          methods to characterize and model spatial and spatiotemporal
          patterns. He is trained in earth sciences, computer science,
          applied statistics, geographic information science and remote
          sensing. He also has several years of experiences in software
          industry before moving back to academia.
