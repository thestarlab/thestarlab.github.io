Guofeng received \$265,058 funding support from National Science Foundation for the project proposal "[Deep Learning in Geospatial Uncertainty Modeling](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2026331&HistoricalAwards=false)". With this support, we will develop deep learning-based spatial statistical methods to address long-standing problems in geospatial analysis, including complex geospatial patterns, geospatial heterogeneity and geospatial uncertainty. New PhD student opportunity is available to work on this exciting project.
