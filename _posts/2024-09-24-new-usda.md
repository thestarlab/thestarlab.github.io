We received $134k funding support from USDA. With the support, we will work with our partner at USDA to develop spatially explicit AI methods and related GIS tools to model the spatiotemporal distrubtion and the impact of Mormon crickets, an important agricutural pest in western US.

We are excited to start this new project. Stay tuned for more updates.
