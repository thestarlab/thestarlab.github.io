After several good years at Texas Tech, we are moving to the Department of Geography, University of Colorado Boulder this Fall. Extremely grateful to my colleagues and friends at Texas Tech and Lubbock communities, particularly my geography family here (best graduate students and Jeff Lee Linda Lea Jones Lucia Barbato and Kevin Mulligan). Super excited about the new adventure!
