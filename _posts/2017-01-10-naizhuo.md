A new paper is published [*The effects of synoptic weather on influenza
infection incidences: a retrospective study utilizing digital disease
surveillance*](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-017-1306-4) in
**International Journal of Biometeorology**. In this paper, we combine the
results of big data-derived digital surveillance (Google Flu Trends) and CDC's
surveillance networks for spatiotemporal distribution of influenza dynamics,
and then investigate the weather and air mass effects on influenza dynamics.
