The project [ATD: Collaborative Research: A Geostatistical Framework for
Spatiotemporal
Extremes](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2220529&HistoricalAwards=false)
was funded by NSF ATD program. We will work with Dr. Dan Cheng from ASU on
this project to develop geostatistical methods for modeling the
spatiotemporal distribution of extreme values in geosciences and climate
sciences, e.g., extreme heat/cold and precipitation events.
