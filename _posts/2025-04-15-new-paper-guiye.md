Guiye published his first first-authored paper titled *Generative Adversarial Models for Extreme Geospatial Downscaling* in the journal of *International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation*. In this paper, we present a GAN-based method for downscaling gridded geospatial data with large scaling factors while accounting for important considerations in scientific downscaling that tend to be ignored in existing methods, such as uncertainty and mass preservation. See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14049) for the paper and related codes.
