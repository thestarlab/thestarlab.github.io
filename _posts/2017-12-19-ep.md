A new paper is published [*Improve ground-level PM 2.5 concentration mapping
using a random forests-based geostatistical
approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749117316469)
in **Environmental Pollution**. In this paper, we produced a gridded PM2.5
concentration datasets with 1 km spatial resolution by combing heterogeneous
data sources via machine learning-based geostatistical methods. Using the
monitoring measurements as a benchmark, our results outperform the most
commonly used datasets. The resultant datasets can be downloaded at our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/thestarlab/data).
