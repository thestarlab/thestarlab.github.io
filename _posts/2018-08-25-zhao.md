Two new papers are published on integrating location-based social media
(LBSM) data and nighttime light (NTL) imagery in socioeconomic research.
The first paper, [*Tweets or nighttime lights: comparison for preeminence
in estimating socioeconomic
factors*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271618302375)
published on **ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing**,
compared the LBSM and NTL imagery in representing socioeconomic factors,
and the other one *Improving nighttime lights imagery with location-based
social media data* published on **IEEE Transactions on Geosciences and
Remote Sensing** addresses the traditional problems in NTL (e.g., blooming
effect) using LBSM data.
