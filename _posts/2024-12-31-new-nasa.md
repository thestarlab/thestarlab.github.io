We will work with collaborators at U of Maryland and NSF NCAR to derive high resolution agricultural land use datasets from satellite imagery for southern High Plains, and to examine the effects of agricultural land use transformations on weather dynamics.

We are excited to start this new project. Stay tuned for more updates.
