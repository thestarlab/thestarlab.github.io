We encourage applications for a postdoctoral research associate position at the Department of Geography, University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), who will primarily work on a NIST-funded project aiming to understand the social and health impacts of natural hazards and climate changes. The postdoc is expected to develop new machine learning-based geospatial methods and new data sources to measure and model short- and long-term social and health effects of windstorms and their interdependence with the built environments and COVID-19 pandemics.

Please submit your applications [here](https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate/30631) and contact me (guofeng.cao@colorado.edu) if there are questions.
