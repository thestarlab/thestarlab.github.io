Our new paper, [*Revisiting the estimations of PM2.5-attributable mortality
with advancements in PM2.5 mapping and mortality
statistics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719307673?via%3Dihub),
was published on the **Science of the Total Environment**. In this paper,
we revisited the estimations of PM2.5-attributable mortality with
advancements in PM2.5 mapping and mortality statistics, and higlighted the
impact of geographic characteristics of geospatial datasets on mortality
estimations.
