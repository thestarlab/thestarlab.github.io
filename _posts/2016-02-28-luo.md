A new paper [*Explore Spatiotemporal and Demographic Characteristics of
Human Mobility via Twitter: A Case Study of
Chicago*](doi:10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.03.001) is published in **Applied
Geography** on human mobility using location-based Twitter data. Many
papers have been reported recently to study the human mobility using
geo-tagged social media data. In this paper, we particularly focus on the
spatiotemporal and demographic characteristics of human mobility by
accounting for the demographic information implied in Twitter profiles and
post contents.
