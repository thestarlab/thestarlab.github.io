A new paper is published in **Applied Geography** on human mobility using
location-based Twitter data. Many papers have been reported recently to
study the human mobility using geo-tagged social media data. In this paper,
we particularly focus on the spatiotemporal and demographic characteristics
of human mobility by accounting for the demographic information implied in
Twitter profiles and post contents. Preprint is available at here: [Explore
Spatiotemporal and Demographic Characteristics of Human Mobility via
Twitter: A Case Study of Chicago](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00188).
