title: Innovative Measurement and Modeling of Dynamical Social and Health Effects of Windstorms
---

The objective of the NIST-funded research project is to develop innovative methods for measuring and modeling short-term and long-term social and health effects of windstorms and their interdependence with built environment. Employing an integrated, interdisciplinary approach, we aim to advance understanding of the fundamental processes associated with natural hazards. 

Please see the following links for the information we have collected for
the past windstorm events.
